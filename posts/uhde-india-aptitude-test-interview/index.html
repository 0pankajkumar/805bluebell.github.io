        <p>NOTE:<br>
The below writing is for my personal diary purpose and treating it as a public article might not be suitable. you may find that its written very roughly. It can be for reference for candidates trying for Uhde India Pvt. Ltd</p>
<p>Q: tell me about yourself<br>
A: i am pankaj kumar. my father was in Indian navy and i am 2nd graduating engineer in my clan. i like mechanical engineering because its very much visible in the real world and it answers many day to day questions</p>
<p>Q: why dint u joined Indian navy<br>
A: because of my little finger</p>
<p>Q: do u have any problem while doing anything with hand<br>
A: whatever u can do,i can do. its normal, no problem at all</p>
<p>Q: what are your favorite subjects<br>
A: thermodynamics, thermal. materials science</p>
<p>Q: what is normalizing?<br>
A: heating above some temperature, i think 723C, (he was confused) holding at that temperature and cooling in air<br>
Q: is it really 723C?<br>
A: yes</p>
<p>Q:what is annealing?<br>
A: only difference, its cooled in furnace itself</p>
<p>Q: what type of grain structure in normalizing?<br>
A: coarse as compared to annealing as its cooled faster</p>
<p>Q: what about annealing?<br>
A: finer grain is obtained</p>
<p>Q: what is formula for hoop stress?<br>
A: its (p<em>d)/(2</em>something). [what is that something ,he didn&rsquo;t asked but it was on his face]</p>
<p>Q: formula for bending stress?<br>
A: sigmaB=M/Z</p>
<p>Q: what is this Z?<br>
A: shear modulus</p>
<p>Q: whats shear modulus?<br>
A: i was blank</p>
<p>Q: (he drew a figure of L section in two rotated views and asked) which has maximum shear modulus?<br>
A: i said i don&rsquo;t know but know that bending will be maximum in one of the figures. (there was a confusion in the figure he drew)<br>
i said that Z is dependent on I and I is different for each geometry. (then it suddenly clicked me). Since the geometries are same I and Z will be same. (he agreed)</p>
<p>Q: can we weld aluminum and stainless steel<br>
A: no idea sir.</p>
<p>HR interview</p>
<p>Q: tell me about yourself?<br>
A: my father was in Indian navy , mother house wife</p>
<p>Q: tell me about extra curricular activities<br>
A: participated in junkyard wars(described the whole process)</p>
<p>Q: any projects?<br>
A: told about mechatronics project. &quot; I was involved in the project from beginning till end (she said , u were alone involved in it?) to which i replied that no. But , i conceived the idea and was there from beginning till end.</p>
<p>Q: any conclusion regarding that?<br>
A: i knew where it failed(told about problem in temperature sensor) and also because of insufficient knowledge in electronics, it failed.</p>
<p>Q: Any other project?<br>
A: i said final year and told the topic ,&ldquo;vibration modal analysis of beams&rdquo;(she was least interested in that)</p>
<p>Q: what do you family and friends think about yourself?<br>
A: (i was fumbled and searching for words in my head) i said that they think i am studious and can achieve great heights in my life</p>
<p>Q: do u think being studious is helpful?<br>
A: yes, i said. (but was still searching for reasons with aaah ummmm and all that sounds up) then finally said that then only u can read from literature and grab knowledge as being studious.</p>
<p>Q: what is your greatest achievement?<br>
A: i liked computer engg. in 12th as i was prone to computer at my home. After joining mechanical i saw much. items like lathe machine and all that. So, i was attracted towards it. now i am proud to be a mechanical engineer.</p>
<p>Q: OK, thank u!<br>
{we shook hands and i departed}</p>
<p>my mouth was dry after speaking for aso long</p>
<p>i decided that my past performance is not that lucrative or good.<br>
Also feel like some of my work is still remaining(i had decided to learn it all of mechanical engineering and become a deserving candidate)<br>
i will have to pull up socks and achieve this great feat</p>
<p>improvement areas:<br>
technical knowledge (S.O.M , production , material science)<br>
interview (prepare thoroughly for HR interview, u failed there!)<br>
Don&rsquo;t forget the aptitude test. keep improving as you had just crossed the boundary in Uhde India&rsquo;s interview</p>
