      <description>The book was all about how one should invest his salary for the retirement without compromising on the present needs. First thing is always to set a goal and save for it from each month&amp;rsquo;s salary. This way you will have some money left after savings which can be spent lavishly on mundane things. In the end you will have the goal fulfilled as well.
So, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything about not to start a company &amp;amp; live in corporate ladder.</description>

      <description>Migrating from Blogger / Blogspot to Hugo Enough of blogger now. It&amp;rsquo;s a good and complete platform but I always want to try newer things. So, I have decided to move my 5-6 year old blog posts to Hugo. There are some 50 posts, I don&amp;rsquo;t write a lot, but that&amp;rsquo;s my treasure.
Currently, it&amp;rsquo;ll be hosted on Github with free domain provided but that shall improve in some time.</description>

      <description>Deepika not padukone She is an ex-collegue. We used to sit in a long bay with all the team of Talent aquisition.
Here is my first impression of her. I hardly noiticed her in the sea of people sitting in the bay. I first noticed her when she went to europe trip. That was one thing which she did from the rest to catch my attention. She travelled with one of her friend &amp;amp; posted a lot of facinating pictures on instagram.</description>

      <description>Is Multithreading really useful  Thread - In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler&amp;hellip; (source : Wikipedia) So, When you divide a program into independently managed pieces of work which can be later combined to have a correct end solution we divide it into chunks called threads.
 But why do we need threads anyway?</description>

      <description>Lessions learnt  The corner cases of testing cases will annoy you. In geeksforgeeks practice they gave back the case whenever you had a failure in submission. Actual cases in competitive programming will not have that luxury. You&amp;rsquo;ll not have that kind of cushion there. Try to make your own corner cases.  </description>

      <description>So, one day I was using too much list &amp;amp; wondered why we can’t use dict all the time when it has O(1) time complexity. Instead of pondering I tried to measure things myself &amp;amp; see. I ended up measuring access time in a dict &amp;amp; in a list. Below is the code.
import time d = dict() for i in range(10000000): d[i] = True e = list() for i in range(10000000): e.</description>

      <description>My first Cookoff Last night I was participating in CodeChef October Cookoff for the first time. It was a good experience even though I could solve one problem completely &amp;amp; two others partially attempted out of total five.
So, there’s a language debate over which should be better for competitive programming. I natively speak in python though I started off with C/C++ family. So, let’s see some comparison over a brute force solution to a problem written in Python (A slow language) and C++ (A fast language).</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is flow of my mind &amp;amp; not a well maintained piece of writing.
The bus was 2+2 semi sleeper of volvo brand but old one. It was comfortable. But soon the A/C started chilling us as we approached lonavala. I went down at lonavala for a pee &amp;amp; started sneezing and shivering, sure signs of hitting cold. I quickly ran inside the bus and covered myself in the warmth of blanket.</description>

At office I told everything exactly. Two days interview &amp;amp; test and I will be absent. I did this because we had an understanding &amp;amp; agreement before I was rolled in that I will be leaving as soon as I get masters opprtunity.
Anyways, the milkman milking cow is curious about how much time she will not give milk &amp;amp; how often.</description>

Since I had applied for gate exam, naturally I had to apply for iits. I applied to top ones only. That too at bombay and madras only. Due to low self esteem after result declaration with AIR 9750 I was sure that no call will come for general category. And it happened like that way. But quite unusually I got a call for MS at iit madras.</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been quite some time since I studied like Rajdhani express. Actually, whenever I start catching up speed weekend comes up. And during weekends we have classes for straight eight hours.A girl at classes is quite bothering. The whole Dadar concept thing is very annoying. The topics being covered up are too much for a technical student.
I have been exploring several youtube filmmakers. I have an idea about genres being covered up there.</description>

      <description>Good Morning !
I have been living in the flow for past one day. It&amp;rsquo;s like studying, breaking up for something else &amp;amp; again going back. The whole picture of gate exam gets clear when you solve question papers as the whole syllabus gets covered.
But still, I am not solving enough numericals to attain the best feel in particular topics &amp;amp; subject.I think one should start feeling very comfortable in topics &amp;amp; subjects.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been well thought off. Or you can say dreamt off.What I will be doing in near future is very uncertain &amp;amp; only god can know. But how I want to see myself few years down the line is as below.
Having a successful career as mechanical engineer will compliment my work for last five years &amp;amp; will be a good backup if future ventures fail anyhow. I know this is the wrong way to proceed.</description>

My mind has been distracting away since some time. I feel so. I am not milking my time these days to its full extent.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time to start swotting like Muhammad Ali.
Working out to find a way myself. Let&amp;rsquo;s see.

Went to classes at late in the day. Met a cute girl. Did differential equations. Tried to start Nodia just after class. In the way learned to do a type not taught in class. Slept well.
Good morning!

      <description>Going on as per plan.
Reason for feeling bad:
I am still following the crowd. It&amp;rsquo;s like crying over split milk.
All was part of your own plan man.
This is how subconscious work.
Just make sure that before leaving you go to all possible branches because some more money will not hurt.
Wait. This is type of risk taking business we were talking about. No, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t had to involve risk always.</description>

  READ books from any genre (fiction or nonfiction), newspapers and print media daily for at least 20 minutes.
  Sleep early, for an optimum duration and wake early.
  Run, work out and stay fit.
  Take a long break from social networking sites, instead, socialize in person. It even enhances social skills.

      <description>sort form various bubbles
say no to other options
do few things, dont be jack of all trades but master of none
give up somethings to acheive more important things
choose your big thing (bike garage owner &amp;amp; aeroplane company ceo)
solve bigger, much bigger problems: size of problems = size of results
be brillant at basics
do your work , your work very well ,,, &amp;amp; leave

      <description>Dilemma.
Don&amp;rsquo;t know which way to go.
Do m.tech or shoot movies or do job.
So it&amp;rsquo;s not dilemma, it&amp;rsquo;s tilemma.
If I go for gate I will have to leave job &amp;amp; prepare for it for Complete academic year. Then I will have option of psu&amp;rsquo;s as well. And life at psu will be damn chill. I hope so.
M.tech from iit or a foreign school will be like living once college life.</description>

      <description>I have been experiencing a set back during these days at Godrej. It&amp;rsquo;s like doing something you don&amp;rsquo;t like much &amp;amp; that too for such a long time. 6 days a week, 8-9 hours ie 48-54 hours per week. After some calculations I come out to be having less than 22 hours per week ; cutting travelling, eating &amp;amp; other shit.
(maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll be late to office today, late enough to be considered as half day)</description>

      <description>A cute girl. When i first saw her it was in my class with another girl. It was a small batch of girls out of which she was the most vibrant &amp;amp; visible person. When she walked with her benchmate Monika it was easily visible. She answered in the class, interacted with AK Singh &amp;amp; talked with her friends.
She sat on second bench of second row. The place apt for being ahead in the class without being the flag bearer.</description>

      <description>She was standing beside deepika. Deepika was offended by an arrogant boy of the class. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact sequence of events but still it was a major incident. We all 9th graders were full of raw blood gleaming into our adolescents.
All the three were standing on stairs. Discussing something vigorously. Deepika had her head down as if wanted to cry. Maybe she had already shed some tears &amp;amp; wanted some more to be.</description>

      <description>The saga of failing ventures. A venture is something which you do outside your comfort zone.
I have just started diving outside my well. This must be the tip of iceberg.
Dated a girl. Although not successfully, but satisfactorily. The good thing is it happened outside my mind. Thanks to her for cooperation. But I must say that, Erica Albright is a bitch. It felt that way in the end.</description>

      <description>It was a long day. Fully resting. Nothing to do much except entertainment &amp;amp; rest of course.
I was thinking of doing a particular thong to be awake through my journey at godrej. It will mean much sense if i crave for something &amp;amp; go after it instead of feeding whatever is thrown over to me.
Hope my resolution will last longer as they suck out all my energy to think during weekdays.</description>

      <description>The direction of waves have reversed. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but i feel guilty. Maybe i had misused my winter break.No that can&amp;rsquo;t be the case. Maybe i messed up with my Sunday.
With almost no plan for it and aspirations unsatisfied, i should direct my energy more towards them.
Why to fall ever and the enjoy the joy of gliding up. In that way i would be struck at the same position throughout.</description>

It was an amazing and thrilling vacation. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure of how i would spend my vacations. My exams went on less painful then the previous ones.
Also they were more engaging and lively. I felt the pulse of each exam much better this seventh semester. Actually one more semester awaits me but this one was to be the last one in which i could prove my metal.
After placements my boat has started sailing in other direction than actually planned at the beginning.</description>

      <description>This was supposed to be my first trek with my schools friends. It all started with a plan readily available at this website. Although it was a well planed trip we had challenges.
Have a peek from various locations.



We started with a local towards Panvel at 0600hrs so that we have enough time to complete the trek. Everything was same as any day of commute in Mumbai involving local trains.</description>

      <description>Making a RC boat out of scratch.
Trying to enter the world of engineers who make things happen by sheer will.
This all has begun with formation of my team for event combat nautica @ Techfest .
We have been thinking a lot and reding a bit on the best possible model which we need, For that we had to fix certain requirements for our boat.
 The water machine should in no way sink as it will be loaded with costly electronics and our hard work.</description>

      <description>It all began at night. I was preparing for aptitude test for the D-day ahead. Did everything i could in that small time gap. It was indeed worth to wait in college and study &amp;ldquo;strength of materials&amp;rdquo;(S.O.M) with my classmates. The fear of S.O.M vanished with that. Then i went to sleep but did not sleep well.
Woke up before 0400hrs , even before alarm rang. As i did not wanted to get out of bed i sneaked deep inside the bedsheets for comfort.</description>

      <description>You were not selected
and Kalpana was killed.
The story is old now. Rejection has taken on me.
What i conclude is that i am weak in one aspect only.
Thst is my academics and career goal. I beleived for a long time time that i was not made for mechanical engineering. But, such a great dicipline can&amp;rsquo;t be left like that.
After all it is my Jaya Bachchan and computer are my Rekha.</description>

      <description>Pondering over the issue which my friends had while installing ANSYS software i came up with this for the world.
 If you dont have this version of ANSYS get it via torrent at http://www.torrentfunk.com/tor/7498799.torrent or magnet url for torrent. After downloading get Daemon tools lite for mounting purpose without which installing might not be possible (you can use other mounting tools of you choice) here http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite or directly here .</description>

      <description>While pondering over various companies i came across some companies which were specially tagged. Although i knew the tags but still wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure. I found out about them. ###
 So, Companies which are owned partially or completely by government are called public sector companies.  There are two types of it :  Primary : Owned &amp;amp; funded by government, completely eg.  Secondary : Majority of shares owned by government and rest is owned by corporations &amp;amp; organizations    </description>

      <description>Q: A glass of water has an ice cube floating in water. The water level just touches the rim of the glass. Will the water overflow when the ice melts?
The question is pretty straight forward. If ice will melt certainly some water will be added unnecessarily to cause an overflow.
Well , to find it out i did it all with just a glass of water so full that a few more drops will cause it to overflow.</description>

      <description>Since this is one of my first blog, i might end up being into confession type of writing.

OK! i wanted every thing good in my since i am awake. Of course every one of us do exactly this.
I always wanted freedom ( inspired from history lessons of freedom). When i joined engineering I was not even aware about what I have just choose for myself. I was fully guided into the scenario by my loved ones.</description>
