<p>She is an ex-collegue. We used to sit in a long bay with all the team of Talent aquisition.</p>
<p>Here is my first impression of her. I hardly noiticed her in the sea of people sitting in the bay. I first noticed her when she went to europe trip. That was one thing which she did from the rest to catch my attention. She travelled with one of her friend &amp; posted a lot of facinating pictures on instagram. It was mesmerizing to watch the europe in the photos. That&rsquo;s it. She returned back &amp; went with the sea of people in the bay.</p>
<p>Our team used to have lunch together in the cafeteria. It was a little odd in the beginning to sit with a all girl gang for me. But I mixed up slowly. She used to have diet food which included exotic looking salad &amp; other healthy kind of stuff. That caught my attention.</p>
<p>Then, during one of those year ending weeks, I think, a lot of collegues were on holidays. So, there were a few of the pack in the bay those days. We discussed physics &amp; technology related stuff &amp; interacted a lot. There I came to know that she yearns to know more about stuff. Some may call her beauty with brains.</p>
<p>After some time the nation went into corona lockdown due to chinese flu in March 2020. She was supposed to leave the comapany &amp; join BrowserStack. We gave her farewell over video call. Actually we made a lot of videos during each of the occasions before lockdown &amp; continued to make a few more while at home. We recorded &amp; sent to the person editing. For one of those I recorded a video of me eating popcorn with a dramatic face. There she noticed me. And we started interacting over whatsapp.</p>
<p>She liked that video &amp; one of her friend agreed. After that we discussed a lot of philosophy over a span of months. She helped me to get in touch with Bharat &amp; guided me in taking the next job &amp; preparation. During all of those interactions I found a person into which I could confide into. This helped me in social interaction as we were literally locked up at homes.</p>
<h3 id="the-confusion">The confusion</h3>
<p>We were &amp; are good friends till now. But I don&rsquo;t know where is this coming into my head. I am liking being in the friend zone. But, sometimes she takes a lot of time replying back over whatsapp. This sets me furious at times. But why should I be? Who are we? Just friends I suppose. Then why is it not going like that? That&rsquo;s the confusion.</p>
<p>Last time I went head on to express it with Shashin on a similar scenerio. I told her over facebook messages &amp; it failed miserably. She stopped replying back. Dead silence!
I deleted her number in anger &amp; now I have just her facebook contact. I fear a similar scenerio will happen with Deepika as well. So being mum for now &amp; going by the wind.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
