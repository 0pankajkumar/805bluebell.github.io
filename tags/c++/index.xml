      <description>Is Multithreading really useful  Thread - In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler&amp;hellip; (source : Wikipedia) So, When you divide a program into independently managed pieces of work which can be later combined to have a correct end solution we divide it into chunks called threads.
 But why do we need threads anyway?</description>

      <description>My first Cookoff Last night I was participating in CodeChef October Cookoff for the first time. It was a good experience even though I could solve one problem completely &amp;amp; two others partially attempted out of total five.
So, there’s a language debate over which should be better for competitive programming. I natively speak in python though I started off with C/C++ family. So, let’s see some comparison over a brute force solution to a problem written in Python (A slow language) and C++ (A fast language).</description>
