      <description>Deepika not padukone She is an ex-collegue. We used to sit in a long bay with all the team of Talent aquisition.
Here is my first impression of her. I hardly noiticed her in the sea of people sitting in the bay. I first noticed her when she went to europe trip. That was one thing which she did from the rest to catch my attention. She travelled with one of her friend &amp;amp; posted a lot of facinating pictures on instagram.</description>

      <description>Is Multithreading really useful  Thread - In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler&amp;hellip; (source : Wikipedia) So, When you divide a program into independently managed pieces of work which can be later combined to have a correct end solution we divide it into chunks called threads.
 But why do we need threads anyway?</description>

      <description>Lessions learnt  The corner cases of testing cases will annoy you. In geeksforgeeks practice they gave back the case whenever you had a failure in submission. Actual cases in competitive programming will not have that luxury. You&amp;rsquo;ll not have that kind of cushion there. Try to make your own corner cases.  </description>

      <description>So, one day I was using too much list &amp;amp; wondered why we can’t use dict all the time when it has O(1) time complexity. Instead of pondering I tried to measure things myself &amp;amp; see. I ended up measuring access time in a dict &amp;amp; in a list. Below is the code.
import time d = dict() for i in range(10000000): d[i] = True e = list() for i in range(10000000): e.</description>

      <description>My first Cookoff Last night I was participating in CodeChef October Cookoff for the first time. It was a good experience even though I could solve one problem completely &amp;amp; two others partially attempted out of total five.
So, there’s a language debate over which should be better for competitive programming. I natively speak in python though I started off with C/C++ family. So, let’s see some comparison over a brute force solution to a problem written in Python (A slow language) and C++ (A fast language).</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is flow of my mind &amp;amp; not a well maintained piece of writing.The bus was 2+2 semi sleeper of volvo brand but old one. It was comfortable. But soon the A/C started chilling us as we approached lonavala. I went down at lonavala for a pee &amp;amp; started sneezing and shivering, sure signs of hitting cold. I quickly ran inside the bus and covered myself in the warmth of blanket.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is flow of my mind &amp;amp; not a well maintained piece of writing.At office I told everything exactly. Two days interview &amp;amp; test and I will be absent. I did this because we had an understanding &amp;amp; agreement before I was rolled in that I will be leaving as soon as I get masters opprtunity.Anyways, the milkman milking cow is curious about how much time she will not give milk &amp;amp; how often.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is flow of my mind &amp;amp; not a well maintained piece of writing.Since I had applied for gate exam, naturally I had to apply for iits. I applied to top ones only. That too at bombay and madras only. Due to low self esteem after result declaration with AIR 9750 I was sure that no call will come for general category. And it happened like that way. But quite unusually I got a call for MS at iit madras.</description>
