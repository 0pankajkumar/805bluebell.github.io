      <description>Deepika not padukone She is an ex-collegue. We used to sit in a long bay with all the team of Talent aquisition.
Here is my first impression of her. I hardly noiticed her in the sea of people sitting in the bay. I first noticed her when she went to europe trip. That was one thing which she did from the rest to catch my attention. She travelled with one of her friend &amp;amp; posted a lot of facinating pictures on instagram.</description>
